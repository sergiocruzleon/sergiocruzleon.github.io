I am a computational physicist working as a doctoral researcher at the Department of Theoretical Biophysics at the [Max Planck Institute of Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/de). I use molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical modeling on supercomputers to unravel the specific role of ions in the folding and functions of nucleic acids.

During my MSc. at the [Institute of Computational Physics](https://www.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/) at Stuttgart University, I worked on quantum mechanical calculations of nucleic acids. Previously, I obtained a BSc. from the Physics department of [Los Andes university](https://fisica.uniandes.edu.co/en).
