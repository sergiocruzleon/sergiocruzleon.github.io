======
I am a computational physicist working as a doctoral researcher at the Department of Theoretical Biophysics at the [Max Planck Institute of Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/de) in Germany. I use molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical modeling on supercomputers to unravel the specific role of ions in the folding and functions of nucleic acids.
