I am a computational physicist working as a doctoral researcher at the Department of Theoretical Biophysics at the [Max Planck Institute of Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/de) in Germany. I use molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical modeling on supercomputers to unravel the specific role of ions in the folding and functions of nucleic acids.

During my MSc., at the [Institute of Computational Physics](https://www.icp.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the Stuttgart University, I worked on quantum mechanical calculations of nucleic acids.
